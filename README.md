# IoT-Air-Quality-Monitoring
The project consists in the deployment of an IoT application for smart home scenarios, including functionalities of IoT-based monitoring of indoor environmental parameters such as temperature, humidity and gas concentration, data collection and data forecasting.

Data Analytics is represented by a python notebook which includes some data processing and three forecasting models (FB Prophet, ARIMA, RandomForestRegressor by Sklearn). Furthermore, it computes the average delay between sending the sensor values and receiving them.
